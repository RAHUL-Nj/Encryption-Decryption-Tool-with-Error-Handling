Project Description: Enhanced Encryption/Decryption Tool with Error Handling
The Enhanced Encryption/Decryption Tool is a web-based application that empowers users to encrypt and decrypt text using different encryption algorithms, including the Caesar Cipher and a basic substitution cipher. This tool is designed with a user-friendly interface and integrates error handling to guide users regarding any incorrect inputs, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience.

Key Features:
Intuitive User Interface:
The project provides an intuitive and simple-to-use interface where users can input the text they wish to encrypt or decrypt, specify the encryption key, and choose the desired encryption algorithm.

Algorithm Selection:
Users have the option to choose between two popular encryption algorithms: the Caesar Cipher and the Substitution Cipher. Each algorithm follows a specific encryption and decryption logic.

Text Encryption:
Users can enter the text they want to encrypt, input a valid key, and select the encryption algorithm of their choice. The application then applies the chosen encryption algorithm to the text, displaying the encrypted result.

Text Decryption:
Similarly, users can input the encrypted text, the original key, and select the appropriate algorithm for decryption. The application decrypts the text and presents the decrypted result.

Error Handling and User Guidance:
The tool incorporates error handling to validate user inputs, ensuring both the text and the key are provided. It provides specific error alerts to guide the user in case of invalid inputs, ensuring a seamless and informative user experience.

Encryption Algorithms:
Caesar Cipher:

The Caesar Cipher algorithm involves shifting each character in the text by a fixed number of positions (the key) in the alphabet. It supports both encryption and decryption, shifting characters to the right for encryption and to the left for decryption.
Substitution Cipher:

In the Substitution Cipher algorithm, each character in the text is replaced with a corresponding character from a provided key. The key must be a valid permutation of the alphabet. This algorithm also supports both encryption and decryption.
Error Handling:
The tool validates user inputs to ensure both the text and key are provided.
For the Caesar Cipher, it ensures the key is a valid number.
For the Substitution Cipher, it verifies that the key is a valid permutation of the alphabet.
